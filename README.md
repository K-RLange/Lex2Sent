# Lex2Sent - A bagging approach to unsupervised Sentiment Analysis
Lex2Sent is a text classification/clustering model that can be used with minimal a-priori-information to classify texts into two classes. While the [original paper](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2209.13023) used it for sentiment analysis on english documents, it is not limited to that purpose, but can be used for any arbitrary type of classification and language as long as there are lexica that can be used as an information-basis.
